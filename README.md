# LanaBot

My first Discord bot created to pick multiplayer game because me and my friends are terribly indecisive.

Must have:
  - pick a random game from the list.
  - add new games to list.
  - list all games.

Should have:
  - tags associated with game so random game is chosen from subsetof all games. Tags denote genre/type (eg RTS, funny etc).

Would like to have:
  - implement a vote from a short list.
  - allow users to ad/remove games.
  - allow users to add/remove tags.
  - allow users to create a short list from which a random game will be chosen.
